## Intro

Experienced developer and security researcher with extensive experience in a wide array of fields, from kernels to compilers, allocators to cryptography.

Proficient in Python, C, and growing expertise in Rust and Go. Passionate about vulnerability research, reverse engineering, system exploitation, and cryptographic analysis.

Always pushing the limits—whether tackling pwn.college, cryptopals, or working on my personal OS project.

## Work

I specialize in software security, focusing on reverse engineering, cryptographic analysis, and low-level system programming.

My experience includes working with Python, C, Rust, and Go, along with deep knowledge of memory allocators, compilers, and OS internals.

I’m actively engaged in research, CTF challenges, and building an operating system from scratch.

## About

Hi, I’m Julian! I'm a security researcher and software engineer passionate about low-level programming, reverse engineering, and cryptographic security.

I have experience with machine languages (x86, ARM, MSP430) and enjoy exploring system misuse, shellcoding, and exploitation techniques.

My interests extend beyond work—I love programming challenges, research, and contributing to the security community. Whether at a conference or debugging kernel code, I’m always learning.
